# hello-world

I've recently learnt the basics of HTML and CSS and completed a few projects on FreeCodeCamp. 
I then hopped into Javascript and discovered it is a different kettle of fish entirely. 
Now I am here to cpmplete this GitHub tutorial before I return to my Javascript lessons to hopefully dispel the clouds of question marks that are currently swirling above my head. 
Goodluck to me, a code newbie. (hey it rhymes!)
